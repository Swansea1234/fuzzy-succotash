JavaScript Project
This project is a simple demonstration of fundamental JavaScript concepts, including variable declarations, conditional statements, custom functions, loops, and DOM interactions. The goal is to provide a clear, commented, and organized example for learning or reference.

Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file containing the project's structure and interactive elements.

style.css: The stylesheet for visual presentation.

script.js: The core JavaScript file where all the logic is implemented and clearly commented by section.

Features
Part 1: Variables & Conditionals: Demonstrates variable declarations (const, let) and different types of conditional statements (if/else if/else and switch).

Part 2: Custom Functions: Includes two custom functions to perform simple tasks (addNumbers and createGreeting).

Part 3: Loops: Provides two examples of loops (for and for...of) to iterate over an array.

Part 4: DOM Interactions: Shows how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) by changing text content, adding new elements, and updating the page based on button clicks.

How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Open the developer console (usually F12 or Cmd+Option+I) to see the output from the console.log() statements.

Interact with the buttons on the webpage to see the DOM interactions in action.
